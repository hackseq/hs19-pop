MedPOP

##Overall goal is to understand and model polypharmacy
##End goal to understand the effects of multiple medications

##Deliverables
#update number of input medications from 3 - 5
#use legitimate data to model drug interactions

##Website overview
#website is split into two halves (left and right)
#Left half: user inputs a list of drugs and IBM RXN returns info about each drug
#Right half: uses LASSO for simple ML to determine which drugs use the same pathway

1) Get data from IBM RXN.
2) Use R shiny for prototyping the website.
3) Display data on site.
