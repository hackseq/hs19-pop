Polypharmacy is the description of the untoward effects that arise when multiple medications are consumed by a person. The limit currently recorded for viewing the drug impacts is five.  Five is a seemingly arbitrary number that has been assigned for when any number of drugs, innocuous or not, seems to be a deadly mixture.  Polypharmacy is not well-studied or well-understood.  PolyMapper aims to determine untoward reactions prior to prescribing drugs in order to provide doctors and pharmacists a database to refer to prior to doling out medications.

# Build Status

# Code Style 

# Tech/Framework Used
Website is being developed in R-Shiny.
APIs used for chemical structure modelling and pathway visualization: PubChem.

# Features
The website has a predictive modelling interface that utilizes both computer generated chemical structure images and structure name inputs to provide a forecast of the chemical reactions that occur in pathways.  

# Installation
Clone repository to your laptop.  
> library(shiny)

> runApp("my_app")
The application will then be usable.
